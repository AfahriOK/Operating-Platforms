# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The gaming room client wanted to make their currently popular android game "Draw It or Lose It" playable on multiple platforms  

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

Researching the different requirements and advantages of the different operating systems for my evaluation section.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The Domain model helped me a lot when designing the code. It was a easy bluepront to follow and implement.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise my recommendation section. I wouold recommend the game to be on a cloud server and the game app should run from the cloud so that any platform with a browser can use it. The game would send the resources to the client before the games so that it could load into their ram for fast rendering.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

We knew the users wanted to reach the most people possible with their app so this made windows the best choice for me since 91% of PC users use windows. It's important to consider the users' needs because if you dont achieve them then your project will always be a failure in their eyes.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I had to sit down and analyze what axactly the customer wanted along with the design constraints. Then I would start to draw out a UML diagram so that when I am ready to code it will be simple.
